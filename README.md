About
-----

This is my own version of Perk-A-Cola in real world with a plus, you can turn
on/off the bottle and play/stop the Perk-A-Cola song through the web interface
which communicate with the GPIO pins of the RaspBerry Pi.

The main file is index.cgi which contains: HTML5 + CSS + javascript + GPIO

The same code can be modified and used to communicate with microcontroller,
like [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc)
